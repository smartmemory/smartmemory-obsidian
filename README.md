# SmartMemory for Obsidian

Bring [SmartMemory](https://smartmemory.ai)'s entity extraction, knowledge graph, multi-hop search, and contradiction detection into your Obsidian vault.

> **Requires a SmartMemory account.** A free tier is available (1,000 notes, 200 searches/day). Paid tiers unlock higher quotas and team workspaces.

## Features

- **Vault ingest** — turn any note into a structured memory item with extracted entities and relations.
- **Search & Recall** — multi-hop semantic search across your whole vault from a sidebar pane or `Cmd+Shift+R` floating modal.
- **Entity backlinks** — auto-extracted entities become clickable chips that find every note referencing the same person, project, or concept.
- **Knowledge graph pane** — focused N-hop neighborhood graph centered on the active note.
- **Auto-link** — propose `[[wikilinks]]` for entity mentions; preview-and-accept never modifies code blocks, frontmatter, or existing links.
- **Inline suggestions** — debounced "Related: [[Note A]], [[Note B]]" widget while you type (opt-in).
- **Contradiction banner** — when a memory has been superseded server-side, you see it inline with a "View derivation history" button.

## Install

### Via BRAT (recommended while we are pre-directory)

1. Install the [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin from the community directory.
2. Open BRAT settings → "Add Beta Plugin" → paste `smartmemory/smartmemory-obsidian` → Add.
3. Enable "SmartMemory" in Settings → Community plugins.

### Manual

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/smartmemory/smartmemory-obsidian/releases/latest).
2. Drop them into `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/smartmemory/`.
3. Enable "SmartMemory" in Settings → Community plugins.

### Coming soon

Direct install from Obsidian's Community plugin directory (submission pending).

## Setup

1. Create a SmartMemory account at [app.smartmemory.ai](https://app.smartmemory.ai) and copy your API key from Settings → API Keys.
2. In Obsidian: Settings → SmartMemory → paste API key, set workspace ID, save.
3. Status-bar dot turns green once connected.

API key can also be supplied via the `SMARTMEMORY_API_KEY` environment variable, which takes precedence over the settings field.

## Privacy & data

- All network calls go to your configured SmartMemory API URL (default: `https://api.smartmemory.ai`).
- Note content sent on ingest, search, and recall is processed server-side for entity extraction and embedding. Your data lives in your SmartMemory workspace under your account.
- The plugin stores a local mapping (`<plugin-data>/data.json`) of vault path → SmartMemory item ID and a content hash for re-ingest detection. No vault content is logged anywhere outside Obsidian and your SmartMemory account.
- The plugin does not collect telemetry. The status-bar connection probe (a single `GET /memory/list?limit=1` on load) is the only background call.

## Quotas & free tier

- Free tier: **1,000 notes**, **200 searches/day**.
- Hitting the note cap: ingest returns 429; the plugin shows an upgrade modal.
- Hitting the daily search cap: search returns 429; a non-blocking notice surfaces.
- Both errors are non-destructive — the plugin never deletes vault content.

## Settings reference

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| API URL / API Key / Workspace ID | Connection |
| Auto-ingest on save / on create | Toggle automatic ingest of vault changes |
| Exclude folders | Comma-separated path prefixes (e.g. `templates/, .obsidian/`) — not glob patterns |
| Write entities / relations / memory_type / sync timestamp | Per-field toggles for what gets written back to frontmatter |
| Suggestion frequency (off / 5s / 2s / 1s) | Inline-suggestion debounce |
| Contradiction banner | Toggle the supersession warning + sweep interval |
| Graph max nodes / max hops | Knowledge-graph pane bounds |

## Compatibility

- Obsidian **1.5.0** and above.
- Desktop and mobile (the plugin sets `isDesktopOnly: false`; mobile is supported but the graph pane is bandwidth-heavier than the rest).
